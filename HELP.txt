Macul - event-driven consumer based on redis and asyncio

asyncio scheduler. Python asyncio is missing scheduling features
Why yet another scheduler?

- it's accurate and extremely fast - no unnecessary polling loops,
only PriorityQueue for jobs and long sleeps
- all sync methods are 100% thread-safe

What can it do:

- execute coroutine with the specified interval in seconds/milliseconds
- execute max number of times
- delayed execution

That's all. I focus on speed and keep it simple.
